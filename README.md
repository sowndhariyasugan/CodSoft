# CodSoft Internship Tasks

Welcome to the CodSoft internship task repository! This repository contains a series of Java projects completed during the internship. Each project focuses on different aspects of Java programming and application development.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Number Game

#### Objective:
Develop a number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range.

#### Details:
1. Generate a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback (correct, too high, too low).
4. Repeat until the user guesses the correct number or exceeds the attempt limit.
5. Implement multiple rounds and track scores based on attempts or rounds won.

### Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

#### Objective:
Create an application to calculate total marks, average percentage, and assign grades based on input marks.

#### Details:
1. Input marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject.
2. Calculate total marks and average percentage.
3. Determine grades based on the average percentage achieved.
4. Display results including total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade to the user.

### Task 3: ATM Interface

#### Objective:
Design and implement a console-based ATM interface for banking operations.

#### Details:
1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. Design user interface options: withdraw, deposit, check balance.
3. Implement methods for each option (withdraw, deposit, check balance).
4. Create a class for the user's bank account with balance management.
5. Validate user input for transactions (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
6. Display appropriate transaction messages based on user actions.

### Task 4: Quiz Application with Timer

#### Objective:
Develop a quiz application with timed questions and scoring.

#### Details:
1. Store quiz questions with multiple-choice options and correct answers.
2. Implement a timer for each question to limit answer time.
3. Display one question at a time with options for user selection.
4. Allow users to submit answers within the given time frame.
5. Calculate scores based on correct answers and display results at the end.

### Task 5: Student Course Registration System

#### Objective:
Build a system to manage student course registrations and course details.

#### Details:
1. Manage a Course Database with course code, title, description, capacity, and schedule.
2. Maintain a Student Database with student ID, name, and registered courses.
3. Display available courses with details and available slots.
4. Enable student registration for courses from available options.
5. Implement course removal functionality for students to drop registered courses.
